SchemaCrawler
=============
[SchemaCrawler](http://schemacrawler.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source Java API that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with plain old Java objects.

SchemaCrawler is also a database schema discovery and comprehension, and schema documentation tool. You can search for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format, and find potential design issues with lint . The output is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is bundled with drivers for some commonly used RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports Java.

Features
========
* SchemaCrawler grep to find tables and columns using regular expressions
