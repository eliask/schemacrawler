          SchemaCrawler is a command-line tool that allows you to search your database for tables and columns
          that match
          a regular expression, much like the standard
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>
          tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SchemaCrawler command-line allows filtering tables, views, columns, stored procedure and function based on regular expressions,
          in addition to the grep functionality. This can be useful, say, when you want to search through your schema
          to find all tables that have a CUSTOMER_ID column, for example.
