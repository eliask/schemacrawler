SchemaCrawler Grep is a command-line tool to search for tables that contain
columns matching regular expressions in your database schema.

To use SchemaCrawler Grep:
1. Create a working directory, and copy the program jar file to that
   directory.
2. Copy your database driver jar or zip files to the same directory.
3. Modify schemacrawler.config.properties to point to your database.
4. Try not to give your database user DBA permissions - at least when you
   are running SchemaCrawler Grep.
5. Start a command shell, and cd to the working directory.
