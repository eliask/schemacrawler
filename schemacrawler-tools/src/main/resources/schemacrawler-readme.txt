SchemaCrawler is a platform (OS and DB) independent command-line tool to output
your database schema and data in a readable form. The output is designed to be
diff-ed with previous versions of your database schema.

To use SchemaCrawler:
1. Create a working directory, and copy the program jar file to that
   directory.
2. Copy your database driver jar or zip files to the same directory.
3. Modify schemacrawler.config.properties to point to your database.
4. Try not to give your database user DBA permissions - at least when you
   are running SchemaCrawler.
5. Start a command shell, and cd to the working directory.
